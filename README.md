# Concerts Tonight
### Overview

[**Concerts Tonight**](http://kevinrmccraney.github.io/concerts_tonight/) is a mobile-ready map-based site. Events for the current day are marked on the map, via the [SeatGeek API](https://seatgeek.com). Clicking a listing will pan/zoom the map to the venue. The listings are generated by the user's geocoordinates, provided they allow the browser to access their current location. It was built over three or four days, and is my first JavaScript project.

### Technologies Used

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/)
